A program for capturing data sent and received between two points. A proxy. A MITM. A whatever.
Nothing fancy, just basic capture of data. No certificate handling etc.

Usage: java -jar tcptunnel.jar [options] <sourceport> <remotehost> <remoteport>
Parameters:
  <sourceport> : The port to bind and wait for connections on localhost.
  <remotehost> : The host to connect to and forward traffic when someone connects to <localport>.
  <remoteport> : The port on the <remotehost> to connect to and forward traffic when someone connects to <localport>.

Options:
  --buffersize <bytes> : Size of input buffer used to read data in bytes. Defaults to 8192 bytes.
  --encoding <encoding> : Use the given encoding to decode strings. Default is UTF8.
  --down <path> : Write remote->local data stream to file in <path>. Default is tcp_down. Suffix is logger dependent.
  --up <path> : Write local->remote data stream to file in <path>. Default is tcp_up. Suffix is logger dependent.
  --logger <type> : Add specified type of logger. Default is 'console-string'.
  --hex <true/false> : If using a console-bytes logger, defines whether to convert bytes to hex or int in printed lists.
  --help : Prints this help and exits.

Loggers types:
  console-string: Prints logged data as strings (in defined encoding). For upstream to system.out and downstream to system.err.
  console-bytes: Prints logged data as list of byte values. For upstream to system.out and for downstream to system.err.
  file-string: Prints as strings (in defined encoding). To defined output files with .txt ending.
  file-bytes: Writes logged data as list of byte values. To defined output files with .bytes ending.
